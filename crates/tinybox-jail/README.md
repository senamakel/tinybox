# cwd_jail

Cross-platform directory-jail facade. Given a declarative description of a
workspace (`Jail`), it picks the strongest available OS sandbox backend and
spawns a child process caged into a single read/write root (plus optional
read-only paths), with toggles for outbound network and subprocess creation.
It is the user-facing complement to `crates/openhuman-core/src/security/`:
the autonomy gate decides whether a command may run, and `cwd_jail` decides
what filesystem the approved child process sees. It jails the child it
spawns, never the core process itself.

## Responsibilities

- Describe a jail declaratively via a builder (`Jail::new(root, label)` plus
  `.add_read_only(...)`, `.deny_net()`, `.deny_subprocess()`).
- Auto-detect and cache the strongest backend for the current OS (Landlock,
  Seatbelt, AppContainer, or noop).
- Spawn a `std::process::Command` inside the jail, canonicalizing `root`
  (and read-only paths) first so backends never see `..` or symlink
  trickery.
- Provide a persistent registry to manage many jailed workspaces side by
  side, each with a stable id, label, directory, and metadata, indexed in a
  JSON file.
- Fall back to `noop` when no OS-level sandbox is available, while still
  letting callers rely on application-layer path checks.

## Public surface

Re-exported from `mod.rs`:

- `Jail`, `JailBackend`: the declarative jail description and the
  OS-enforcement trait.
- `NoopBackend`, `NOOP_BACKEND_NAME`: the unenforced fallback backend and its
  `name()` string (`sandbox/ops.rs` compares against it to report
  `Inactive`).
- `JailRecord`, `JailRegistry`: persisted multi-jail manager.

Free functions in `mod.rs`:

- `default_backend() -> Arc<dyn JailBackend>`: process-wide cached, lazily
  auto-detected backend.
- `spawn(jail: &Jail, cmd: Command) -> io::Result<Child>`: canonicalize and
  spawn under the default backend.
- `spawn_with(backend: &dyn JailBackend, jail: &Jail, cmd: Command) -> io::Result<Child>`:
  same, with an explicit backend (tests or a forced weaker backend).

`JailRegistry` methods: `open`, `base`, `create`, `get`, `list`,
`find_by_label`, `rename`, `set_notes`, `delete`, `clear`, `spawn_in`,
`spawn_in_with`.

## Persistence

`JailRegistry` is rooted at a base directory (for example `~/.openhuman/jails/`
or `<workspace>/jails/`). Each jail is a `<base>/<id>/` directory; metadata
for all jails lives in `<base>/index.json`.

- `JailRecord` fields: `id`, `label`, `dir`, `backend_at_create`,
  `created_at_unix`, `updated_at_unix`, optional `notes`.
- The on-disk index is the source of truth; in-memory state (`Index`, a
  `BTreeMap` for deterministic ordering) is rebuilt on every `open()`.
- Writes are atomic (write-temp then rename, with a direct-overwrite
  fallback if rename-over fails). Mutating ops roll back the in-memory
  change if persistence fails.
- Ids are generated as `j<ts_hex><counter_hex>` (not cryptographically
  random, used only as directory names), with a collision-retry loop on
  `create`.
- Concurrency is guarded by a `std::sync::Mutex`; multi-process access is an
  explicit non-goal (no OS file locking).

## Dependencies

This module is notably self-contained: its own files contain no
`use crate::` or `use crate::core::` imports. Dependencies are external or
std only:

- `std::process` (`Command`/`Child`), `std::fs`, `std::sync`
  (`Mutex`/`OnceLock`/`Arc`), `std::time`.
- `serde` / `serde_json`: `JailRecord` and the index serialization
  (registry).
- `landlock` crate: Linux backend, gated on the `sandbox-landlock` cargo
  feature.
- `windows-sys`: Windows AppContainer FFI (Security/Isolation, Threading,
  Memory APIs).
- macOS backend shells out to the system binary `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`.

The Linux backend's docstring references `crate::security::landlock` as
conceptual prior art, but the implementation here is self-contained; it does
not import that module.

## Used by

- Declared in `crates/openhuman-core/src/sandbox/mod.rs` (`pub mod cwd_jail;`).
- `crates/openhuman-core/src/sandbox/ops.rs`: `execute_local_jail` builds a
  `Jail` from the resolved `SandboxPolicy` and spawns through
  `cwd_jail::default_backend()`, falling back to `cwd_jail::NoopBackend` when
  no OS jail is available.
- `crates/openhuman-core/src/agent/platform_shell.rs`: doc references to
  `cwd_jail::spawn` when explaining why shell-spawning is routed through a
  shared, Windows-aware command builder.
- `crates/openhuman-core/src/tools/impl/system/{node_exec,npm_exec}.rs`
  mention `cwd_jail` in comments/docs when describing the `Local` sandbox
  backend.

## Notes and gotchas

- Not RPC-facing, no agent tools, no event bus. There is no `schemas.rs`,
  `tools.rs`, or `bus.rs`; the module exposes no `openhuman.*` RPC methods,
  owns no agent tools, and publishes or subscribes to no `DomainEvent`s.
- Backends differ in what `allow_net` and `read_only` mean. Landlock does
  not gate network at all; macOS Seatbelt grants `allow default` (full
  network) and treats `read_only` as informational since reads are already
  allowed; Windows AppContainer is the only backend that honors `read_only`
  as a real read grant and maps `allow_net` to the strictly outbound-only
  `internetClient` capability (LAN and inbound capabilities are deliberately
  excluded).
- Windows `spawn` currently returns an error after a successful launch.
  `spawn_in_container` creates the process successfully but cannot bridge
  the raw `HANDLE` into a `std::process::Child` (the needed
  `FromRawHandle for Child` is unstable), so it closes the handle and
  returns `io::ErrorKind::Unsupported`. See the TODO in `windows.rs`. The
  Windows path is compile-checked but flagged as needing real-hardware
  testing.
- macOS stdio is inherited: the Seatbelt wrapper cannot re-apply the
  original command's `Stdio` config, so it uses `sandbox-exec` defaults
  (inherit). The profile re-allows writes under the canonicalized `root` and
  `/private/tmp`, plus the exact `/dev/null` device for shell redirection;
  it does not grant `/dev` generally. Callers must canonicalize the root
  first (the `spawn` facade does this automatically) or writes inside it may
  be denied (for example `/tmp` resolving to `/private/tmp`).
- Linux Landlock runs in `pre_exec` (child-side, after fork), so the parent
  keeps its privileges; read-only paths also get `Execute` so the child can
  run binaries found there (for example `/usr/bin/sh`).
- Registry containment guard: both `delete` and `jail_for` (used by
  `spawn_in`/`spawn_in_with`) refuse to operate on a record whose
  canonicalized `dir` is not under the canonicalized `base`, defending
  against a corrupted index pointing at `/`.
- Free-form input is length-logged, not value-logged (labels and notes), to
  avoid leaking arbitrary text into logs.
